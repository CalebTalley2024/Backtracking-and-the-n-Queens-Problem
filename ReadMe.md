# HW 6

- Next:  int array to Square array (setting up all variables properly)
- for now: int array input is 1-based, while the rest of the code is 0 based
- array positions are NOT based on chess (letterCol, numberRow), they are based on matrix (row,column)
- in this function, length is synonymous with size (chess board has "size" 8 here, NOT 64)
# part 2
- when an array inputed has no nextValid postion, you will just receive an array of 0s
